# js-methods-vs-performance
How in different use cases, we have to choose best javascript method to handle performance of Algorithms.
our usecase is to check duplicate from the array If there is duplicate return true otherwise false.Then check that which javascript method or algorithms works
best depending on the size of array.
My conclusion is that best algorithm was to use objectSolution for our usecase.or on bigger Scale.
